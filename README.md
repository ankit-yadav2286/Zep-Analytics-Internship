# PROBLEM STATEMENT
* Information of different wineries and their wines are given and we want to fit a regression model to predict the price of each bottle.
* We want to understand what factors are affecting price of wine.

# Data Description
winery: Winery name
wine: Name of the wine
year: Year in which the grapes were harvested
rating: Average rating given to the wine by the users [from 1-5]
num_reviews: Number of users that reviewed the wine
country: Country of origin [Spain]
region: Region of the wine
price: Price in euros [€]
type: Wine variety
body: Body score, defined as the richness and weight of the wine in your mouth [from 1-5]
acidity: Acidity score, defined as wine's “pucker” or tartness; it's what makes a wine refreshing and your tongue salivate and want another sip [from 1-5]

 # Conclusion
 The ensemble models have performed well compared to that of linear, Decision Tree.
The best performance is given by the Xtreme Gradient boosting model.
The top key features that drive the price of the wine are: rating , year , wine , acidity , region etc.
We can conclude from above that xtreme gradient boosting GridSearch CV is giving better results compared to that of normal gradient boosting.
The above data is also reinforced by the analysis done during bivariate analysis.
